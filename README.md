# wacky-sm64-rm-tweaks
SM64 Rom Manager Tweaks I either made or have found in the past, that aren't(?) in the official tweaks database.

folder structure:
> /
- tweaks I have found
> /jecket/
- tweaks I have made
> /doesn't work/
- tweaks I tried making or have tried out, but without success

### please note that some of the weaks may not be credited correctly, may not work with the latest version, or could have breaking changes somewhere else in the game
